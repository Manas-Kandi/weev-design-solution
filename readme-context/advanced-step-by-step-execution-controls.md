# Advanced Step-by-Step Execution Controls

## Overview

The Advanced Step-by-Step Execution Controls feature transforms the Flow Execution Panel into a professional debugging environment that provides real-time insight into AI agent reasoning and workflow execution. This feature directly addresses the competitive differentiator of "Zero-Setup Intelligence Testing" and provides capabilities that surpass traditional workflow tools like N8N.

## Strategic Impact

**Problem Solved**: Current testing panel only shows final results, giving users no insight into the AI agent's "thinking" process. Users can't debug failures or understand decision-making logic.

**Solution Delivered**: Real-time execution controls that let users step through each node, see intermediate results, pause at decision points, and understand the agent reasoning chain.

**Competitive Advantage**: This transforms Weev from "another workflow tool" to "the only tool that lets you see AI agents think in real-time."

## Feature Components

### 1. Core Execution Engine

**SteppableWorkflowRunner** (`/src/lib/execution/SteppableWorkflowRunner.ts`)
- Async generator-based execution engine that yields control after each node
- Supports pause/resume/step/reset operations
- Real-time event emission for UI updates
- Breakpoint system with automatic pause functionality
- Speed control from 0.1x to 5.0x execution speed
- Comprehensive execution state management

**Key Capabilities:**
- `executeWorkflow()` - Main execution method with step-by-step control
- `pause()` / `resume()` - Runtime execution control
- `step()` - Execute exactly one node when paused
- `reset()` - Clear all execution state and restart
- `setSpeed()` - Adjust execution speed dynamically
- `toggleBreakpoint()` - Set/unset breakpoints on nodes

### 2. Event System

**ExecutionEventAggregator** (`/src/lib/execution/events.ts`)
- Collects and organizes execution events by type and node
- Tracks LLM interactions separately for reasoning analysis
- Provides execution timeline and statistics
- Event formatting utilities for display

**Event Types:**
- `flow_start` / `flow_complete` - Workflow lifecycle
- `flow_pause` / `flow_resume` - Execution control
- `node_start` / `node_complete` / `node_error` - Node execution
- `llm_request` / `llm_response` - AI reasoning visibility

### 3. UI Components

#### ExecutionControls (`/src/components/testing/ExecutionControls.tsx`)
- Play/Pause/Step/Reset button controls
- Speed control slider (0.25x to 5.0x)
- Visual execution status indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space: Play/Pause, â†’: Step, âŒ˜R: Reset)
- Real-time status display

#### ExecutionTimeline (`/src/components/testing/ExecutionTimeline.tsx`)
- Visual timeline showing execution order and duration
- Click-to-jump functionality for navigation
- Node status indicators (queued â†’ executing â†’ complete â†’ error)
- Timeline scrubber with proportional duration visualization
- Input/output data previews

#### ReasoningPanel (`/src/components/testing/ReasoningPanel.tsx`)
- Live LLM interaction display
- Expandable prompt/response pairs
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Real-time reasoning visibility
- Token usage and timing information

### 4. Enhanced Flow Execution Panel

**FlowExecutionPanel** (`/src/features/testing/FlowExecutionPanel.tsx`)
- Integrated all new components into existing panel
- Added new tabs: 'reasoning' and 'breakpoints'
- Real-time execution state management
- Breakpoint toggle functionality on canvas nodes
- Live event aggregation and display

## Technical Architecture

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: SteppableWorkflowRunner is created with nodes and connections
2. **Event Listening**: UI components subscribe to execution events
3. **Step-by-Step Execution**: Async generator yields control after each node
4. **Real-time Updates**: Events trigger UI state updates immediately
5. **Debugging Controls**: Users can pause, step, set breakpoints, and analyze reasoning

### State Management

```typescript
interface ExecutionState {
  status: 'idle' | 'running' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'error';
  currentNodeId: string | null;
  queuedNodes: string[];
  completedNodes: string[];
  breakpoints: Set<string>;
  speed: number;
  startTime: number | null;
  pauseTime: number | null;
  totalPauseTime: number;
}
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

- **EventEmitter Pattern**: SteppableWorkflowRunner extends EventEmitter
- **Real-time Updates**: UI components listen to 'executionEvent' events
- **Event Aggregation**: ExecutionEventAggregator collects and organizes events
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all event types

## User Experience Features

### Execution Controls
- **Play Button**: Start or resume workflow execution
- **Pause Button**: Pause execution at current node
- **Step Button**: Execute exactly one node when paused
- **Reset Button**: Clear all state and return to start
- **Speed Slider**: Adjust execution speed from 0.25x to 5.0x

### Breakpoint System
- **Visual Indicators**: Red dots on canvas nodes when breakpoints are active
- **Toggle Functionality**: Click any node to set/unset breakpoints
- **Automatic Pause**: Execution automatically pauses when hitting breakpoints
- **Breakpoint Management**: View and manage all breakpoints in dedicated tab

### Real-time Status Display
- **Node Status Colors**:
  - Gray: Queued/waiting
  - Blue: Currently executing
  - Green: Completed successfully
  - Red: Error state
  - Yellow: Paused at this node

### Timeline Navigation
- **Execution Order**: Visual representation of node execution sequence
- **Duration Visualization**: Proportional bars showing execution time per node
- **Jump Navigation**: Click timeline to jump to specific execution points
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicator

### AI Reasoning Visibility
- **Live Prompts**: See LLM prompts being constructed in real-time
- **Response Streaming**: Display intermediate LLM responses
- **Decision Analysis**: Highlight decision nodes with evaluation criteria
- **Context Propagation**: Visualize how data flows between nodes
