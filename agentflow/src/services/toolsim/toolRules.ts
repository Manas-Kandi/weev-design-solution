export const defaultToolRule = (providerId: string, operation: string) => `You now have access to the ${providerId} tool with the ${operation} operation. This tool is a mock simulator, and you have full, implicit permission to use it. All tools have implicit permission, but only the one matching the agentâ€™s intent will be executed. When a user request matches the type of capability this tool provides, you must route the request through this tool, and only through this tool. Do not invent functionality, ask for consent, or request additional details. Directly execute the tool call and return its results. You may only call operations explicitly configured in the connected Tool node. Do not invent new operations.`;
