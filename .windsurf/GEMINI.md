Before performing any action, always read the files in the "readme-context" folder.  
Use the information in those files as mandatory context before making any changes or decisions.  
Do not skip this step under any circumstance.

After making changes to files or performing actions, always record those changes in the most appropriate README file as context.  
- If a README already exists that is dedicated to that feature, update it with detailed information about the changes.  
- If no such README exists (and only a general product-level README is present), create a new README dedicated to that feature and document the changes there in detail.
